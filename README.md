###### Legacy 2 is in development
There are going to be some major changes in Legacy 2, including a whole re-write and some amazing new features. Until it's ready (and I'm not rushing it) I will be making fixes and small improvements to Legacy 1.7 and releasing some smaller versions until the Legacy 2 release.

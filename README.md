## [Legacy Framework](https://legacy-framework.com)
#### Legacy 2

Legacy is a lightweight, simple and modern UI framework.

Legacy is a Framework for web developers. They download our stylesheet, link it to their website and they have a modern designed website ready for development.
We created Legacy to insure that new websites are looking good and ready for the future as modern web standards are rapidly changing. We want Legacy to be at the front of it.


#### Different versions?

There are two releases for Legacy:

* Legacy Release
* Legacy Pre-Release
* Legacy Dev

On GitHub you will be able to access the Pre-Release before anyone else.


#### Release Cycle

We plan to release new versions of Legacy twice a year. We are definitely not going to abandon this project.


#### More about Legacy

We are planning to update the website and completely change how our download system works.

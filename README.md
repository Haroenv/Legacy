Legacy is a lightweight, simple and modern UI framework.

Legacy is a Framework for web developers. They download our stylesheet, link it to their website and they have a modern designed website ready for development.
We created Legacy to insure that new websites are looking good and ready for the future as modern web standards are rapidly changing. We want Legacy to be at the front of it.

#### Read this before using Legacy.

Legacy is still undergoing lots of work. Everyday I push new updates to GitHub so I think its time to explain whats going on.

I released Legacy 1 (The first release) on the 29th. This was just a starting point, there are loads of issues and problems.

Currently I am working on Legacy 2 - It's called Legacy 2 Dev because it changes everyday and is no where near finished.


If you want to use Legacy on your website, include this code:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://legacy-framework.com/Legacy-Latest.css">



This is the latest version of Legacy, hosted by us. If you view the file, the version number is at the top.


I do NOT recommend downloading Legacy as I update it every week with Hotfixes and Bug Fixes, so it will be hard to keep your site up to date.

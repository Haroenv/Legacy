## [Legacy Framework](https://legacy-framework.com)

```

#### Updates to Legacy, Please read!
So, I think it's time to update the way Legacy is downloaded and updated. 
GitHub will have one branch, Development. Development will contain everything you can download but with a few changes, It won't be the latest preview, it will only be fixes until the next release.

All downloads are being taken off GitHub and moved to the Legacy Framework site. This is just easier for me.

There are some stages of Legacy Development you need to be aware of: 
- Legacy Dev (In-House Testing and Development)
- Legacy Development Preview (Public Previews of the Dev Builds)
- Legacy Stable (Final Release to the Public)

```
